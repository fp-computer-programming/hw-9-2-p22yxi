### Nested Loops

---
Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw9-2-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file.

1. (5 pts.) Write a program that is similar to Lab 4-1 from this cycle, but instead of making the student's name possessive, add each student's last initial to their name. Be sure to use the following lists in your solution:
   ```
   last_initials = ["A", "B", "B", "D", "D", "G", "G", "J", "K", "L", "P", "S", "T", "T", "V", "W"]

   rows = [["Mateo", "Jason", "Jordan", "Mohamed", "Michael", "Charlie", "Declan"], ["Sean", "Luis", "Ryan", "James", "Jack"], ["Aiden", "Ian", "Colin" "Tim", "Cam"], ["Larry", "Spencer", "Chris", "Ryan", "Nolan"]]
   ```
   Your program must not create any new lists and must modify `rows` so that the result of `print(rows)` is this:
   ```
   [["Mateo B.", "Jason D.", "Jordan H.", "Mohamed E.", "Michael G.", "Charlie G.", "Declan H."], ["Sean R.", "Luis M.", "Ryan L.", "James I.", "Jack I."], ["Aiden N.", "Ian N.", "Colin O." "Tim P.", "Cam P."], ["Larry X.", "Spencer T.", "Chris S.", "Ryan S.", "Nolan P."]]
   ```
